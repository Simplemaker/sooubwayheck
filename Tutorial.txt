This is a basic explanation of the sooubwayheck language.

The memory consists of a tape 1024 cells long. 
There is a single pointer on the tape that can move right and left along the tape.
The pointer starts at the far left side of the tape.
Cells store a value from -127 to 128.
The term 'current cell' referrs to the cell currently pointed to by the pointer.

A program consists of the following commands:
 soubway: move the pointer right 1 cell.
 sooubway: move the pointer left 1 cell.
 soooubway: increment the current cell by 1.
 sooooubway: decrement the current cell by 1.
 soooooubway: print the ascii character corresponding to the value of the current cell.
 sooooooubway: input a number and store it in the current cell.
 soooooooubway: if the current cell is equal to zero, jump forward in the program 
to the corresponding sooooooooubway command.
 sooooooooubway: if the current cell is not equal to zero, jump back in the program
to the corresponding soooooooubway command.

The only case-sensitive letter is o. All other letters can be capital or lowercase.
See new.sub for an example.
